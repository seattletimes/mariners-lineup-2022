France was one of the Mariners’ most consistent hitters last season, finishing with an OPS of .813 and also providing solid fielding at first base, a relatively new position for him. He seems set for another solid season and it wouldn’t be surprising to his homer total take a jump forward this season.",

During the 2020 shortened season, he hit .202 with 15 homers and last season hit .198 with 31 homers. Which version of Suarez are the Mariners getting?
